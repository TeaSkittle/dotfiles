# :rice: Rice

A simple rice/dotfiles repo for my home PC. *(This is a constant work in progress and is always changing)*. The setup.sh file is meant to be ran after a debian/ubuntu based install with a DE.

## Setup
To install run:  

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeaSkittle/dotfiles/master/setup.sh | bash
```
