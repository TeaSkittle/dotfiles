# :rice: Rice

A simple rice/dotfiles repo for my home PC. *(This is a constant work in progress and is always changing)* The setup.sh file is meant to be ran after a debian/ubuntu based install with a DE.

## Setup

Log in as root after base install and run these commands ( replacing what is in all caps )

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teaskittle/dotfiles
cd dotfiles/
chmod 775 setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
``
